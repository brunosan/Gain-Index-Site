    "body": "The Readiness Matrix illustrates the comparative resilience of countries. The vertical axis measures the relative vulnerability of countries. The horizontal axis measures to what degree a country is prepared to deal with climatic and environmental changes.\n\n###Red, or Upper Left Quadrant\n\nA country with a high exposure to climatic change, but a low level of readiness, has both a great need for investment and innovations to improve readiness and a great urgency for action.\n\n###Yellow, or Lower Left Quadrant\n\nA country that has both low vulnerability and low ability to adapt faces few immediate challenges and therefore has more time to improve the ability to cope. There are likely specific, profitable opportunities for the government, international organizations and the private sector to intervene.\n\n###Blue, or Upper Right Quadrant\n\nThese countries are on the road to responding effectively (high level of readiness), but the remaining needs are greater, as is the urgency to act (high exposure). Because the country has shown an ability to raise its level of readiness, the private sector is more likely than in the red quadrant to participate in the effort to improve the ability to adapt.\n\n###Green, or Lower Right Quadrant\n\nIn countries with low vulnerability but a high ability to adapt, some adaptation challenges may still exist, but these countries require the least help. They are already well along the road to responding effectively to sudden climatic or environmental changes.\n\n"
