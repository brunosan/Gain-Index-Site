The vertical axis measures the relative vulnerability of countries. The horizontal axis measures to what degree a country is prepared to deal with climatic and environmental changes. Divisions for the quadrants correspond the the median Vulnerability and Readiness of the world.\n\n###Red, or Upper Left Quadrant\n\n<img src='/assets/gain/images/about-page/upper-left-quadrant.png' class='left' />\nA country with a high vulnerability to climatic change, but a low level of readiness, has both a great need for investment and innovations to improve readiness and a great urgency for action.  Unless the government, international organizations and the private sector move quickly to improve the ability to adapt, significant human suffering will result.  Initially this country is more likely to receive investment from the government or NGOs than from the private sector looking for financial returns.\n\n###Yellow, or Lower Left Quadrant\n<img src='/assets/gain/images/about-page/lower-left-quadrant.png' class='left' />\nCountries that are not highly vulnerable, even if not ready for investment. These countries will have time to prepare. While private investment towards adaptation will be low, few people should be at risk.\n\n###Blue, or Upper Right Quadrant\n<img src='/assets/gain/images/about-page/upper-right-quadrant.png' class='left' />\nCountries in this quadrant are highly vulnerable but are ready to accept adaptation investment. There is strong urgency to act and the private sector is more likely to invest in adaptation relative to the red or yellow quadrants.\n\n###Green, or Lower Right Quadrant\n<img src='/assets/gain/images/about-page/lower-right-quadrant.png' class='left' />\nThese countries have both low vulnerability and are ready and open for investments. They require little help in coping with their adaptation challenges. "
