    "body": "GAIN has been reviewed in draft form in several rounds of Consultation by individuals chosen for their diverse perspectives and technical expertise. The purpose of this independent review is to provide candid and critical comments that will assist the Institute in making GAIN as sound, objective and pragmatic as possible and to ensure that the process meets best standards for objectivity, evidence and responsiveness.\n\nThe review comments and draft manuscript remain confidential to protect the integrity of the deliberative process. Although the reviewers have provided many constructive comments and suggestions, they were not asked to endorse the conclusions or the final version of GAIN, nor did they see the final draft before its release.\n\n##Ongoing Consultation\n\nCoinciding with the release of this version 1.0 we are continuing our Open Consultation process to make GAIN as sound, objective and pragmatic as possible.\n\nExamination of responses will be in accordance with best practices. Individual feedback from reviewers will remain confidential to protect the integrity of the deliberative process. However, we would like to acknowledge the reviewers name unless they indicate they wish to remain anonymous.\n\nInterested reviewers are asked to examine the methodology and approach of GAIN, as well as its results and all technical details.\n\nPlease [fill out our questionnaire](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFNhNk9GX295UWF1NExuNzUxRnBSVFE6MQ&ndplr=1) or email us your thoughts to <strong>gain@globalai.org</strong>.\n\nYou can also mail comments to:\n\nGlobal Adaptation Institute    \n1747 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Suite 1125    \nWashington, D.C. 20006    \n\n\n##Revision Notes\n\n###First Brainstorming Session\nWashington, D.C.<br>\nSeptember 14, 2010 \n\nThe Institute convened key scientific, governmental and business leaders in Washington, D.C. to help shape the Institute's work on adaptation metrics and accompanying communication and demonstration projects initiatives. Here, participants discussed the Institute's prioritization of key sectors, such as water and food, and how metrics could help accelerate government and private sector action on adaptation.\n\n###International Workshop on Global Adaptation Metrics\nWashington, D.C.<br>\nOctober 27, 2010\n\nThe Institute gathered scientists, researchers and economists from top international universities, consultancies and research centers to address technical and political issues surrounding [adaptation indicators](https://www.globalai.org/content/global-adaptation-institutes-world-meeting-adaptation-metrics-draws-top-experts). Determining how metrics can help prioritize investment in adaptation and  measure the impact and progress towards greater resilience were key goals. \n\nParticipants stressed that adaptation indicators must address both social behavior and biophysical vulnerabilities and highlighted key elements that make indices useful, verifiable and influential. \n\nHere, the concepts of vulnerability and readiness found in the Readiness Matrix™, were further refined. The Readiness Matrix measures the relative vulnerability of countries against the degree to which a country is prepared to deal with climatic and environmental changes, \n\n###First Working Version: GAIN 0.5\nWashington, D.C.<br> \nFebruary 2011\n\nInternally, the Institute began gathering and testing different indicators and indices that met the recommendations from the previous scientific convenings. Such metrics reflected the concepts of vulnerability (a country’s exposure, sensitivity and ability to cope with climate related hazards) and readiness (the ability of a country’s private and public sectors to absorb resources effectively toward increasing resiliency to climate change and other global forces).     \n\nA working model that combined that combined vulnerability and readiness indicators to create a single ranking of countries and place countries throughout the Readiness Matrix was created. \n\n###Consultation on the Global Adaptation Index\nWashington, D.C.<br> \nMay 3, 2011\n\nScientist from [around the world](http://www.globalai.org/content/bringing-adaptation-world-stage-global-adaptation-institute-concludes-first-annual-meeting) joined the Institute to critique and offer advice to improve the GAIN working model and transform it into a viable, livable and useful index. The Institute considered and implemented many of the methodological, indicator selection and audience-targeting suggestions offered from a variety of scientific, political and communications perspectives. \n\nThe meeting concluded with the formation of a [Council of Scientific Advisors](http://www.globalai.org/content/world-renowned-experts-join-global-adaptation-institute-council-scientific-advisers).\n\n###Revised Version: GAIN 0.7 and Consultation With Council of Scientific Advisors\nGlobal<br>\nJuly 18, 2011\n\nGAIN data was partially ported to Microsoft Excel, from Google docs, for faster development. Revisions to the selection of readiness indicators were made as well as an expansion of vulnerability indicators to take into account infrastructure indicators and differentiate between indicators of quantity and quality. \n\nThe Institute's Council of Scientific Advisors provided feedback on the latest working version of GAIN before opening it up for public feedback. \n\n###Open Consultation\nGlobal<br>\nAugust 15 - September 9\n\nThe Institute dedicated a website to review of GAIN, version 0.8. [Feedback was sought](http://www.globalai.org/content/measuring-what-matters-global-adaptation-institute-launches-open-consultation-process-global) from Institute contacts from around the world as well as through press releases and other communications materials. \n\nIndividuals from 13 countries commented through this venue. The majority of reviewers were from an academic or NGO background. Most respondents found GAIN's tracking of information throughout time to be very important as well as the inclusion of income-adjusted scores and rankings. Many respondents agreed that subnational level scores are important as well. Reviewers responded that NGOs, governments and private investors would be the audiences for which GAIN is most relevant.    \n\nIn addition to individual feedback, the Institute held meetings with several prominent environmental and public policy think tanks and organizations. These included, The Brookings Institution, The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, The World Resources Institute and The Heritage Foundation.\n\nOngoing revisions were incorporated into GAIN 0.9 until final release of GAIN 1.0. \n\n###Release of GAIN 1.0\nGlobal<br>\nSeptember 14, 2011<br>\n\nOn September 14th, the Institute [released](http://www.globalai.org/content/global-adaptation-leaders-unveil-index-help-private-public-sectors-prioritize-investments-ad) GAIN version 1.0 to the public, accompanied by a data-intensive website devoted to making GAIN easy to use and reference, transparent and downloadable. The website was implemented using node.js and MapMill.\n\n##Next Steps\n\n\nThe Institute welcomes recommendations for additional indicators, data sources and methods that can improve both the accuracy and usefulness of GAIN. GAIN will evolve over the next few years, but we will seek to stabilize its structure and measures so that it can become a reference point to assessing progress.\n\nSome of the next steps we are already considering include:\n\n* County comparator: A side by side comparison of the country´s performance on all measures and time.\n\n* Subnational scale: Adaptation takes place in the local level. One of our criteria when selecting measures has been to search for scalable measures where possible. Higher granularity is a difficult but important step looking forward. We are exploring ways to undertake this step.\n\n* Include ecosystems and urban settlements on the Vulnerability Axis.\n\n* Evaluate the country´s awareness of its Adaptation needs and actions taken. I an similar token, include accurate reporting levels as part of the score might be of interest."
