    "body": "Welcome to the data browser for The Global Adaptation Index™ (GaIn™). Powered by completely open data, thirty-eight raw indicators are used to calculate the GaIn™ score of a country, which is intended to represent the overall status of a country with respect to the impending effects of climate change. GaIn™ scores are calculated with the formula below using two primary sub-indices: Readiness and Vulnerability. The readiness score of a country represents the country's overall preparedness to adapt to problems posed by climate change. The vulnerability score captures a country's exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. \n\n###Overview Diagram\n\n\nThe results of The Global Adaptation Index™ are intended to motivate real decisions and progress in response to climate change. Both the public and private sectors can use these results to inform pragmatic investments into national economies. Deeper analysis into specific components, sectors and indicators reveals more industry specific concerns within countries. In these ways, GaIn™ provides a tool for institutions to take immediate and informed steps towards combating the threats of climate change. "
