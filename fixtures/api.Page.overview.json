Countries need to minimize the effects of climate change by adapting. Despite expanding resource commitments from international institutions, public funding alone is not the solution. The private sector will play a key role in providing the necessary additional resources. Global Adaptation Index™ (GaIn™) provides the detailed information needed on both vulnerability and readiness to prioritize and evaluate these needed investments. \n\n  \n\n\n### Two Key Dimensions to Adapt\n\n###Overview Diagram\n\n#### Vulnerability\n\nVulnerability seeks to capture exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. 3 categories represent the core components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, capacity), and 6 key sector indicators (Water, Food and Agriculture, Health, Coastal Protection, Energy and Transport) for each\ncategory.\n\n#### Readiness\n\nReadiness measures how well countries can respond to slow challenges (impact of changing temperatures on crops, growing water shortages) and sudden natural disasters (floods, tornados, earthquakes)."
