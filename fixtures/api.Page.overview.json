    "body": "The world is changing fast. Countries are being challenged to prepare for and, if possible, to minimize the effects of climate change. The challenge is only greater as populations, urbanization, and the economy grow. Despite expanding resource commitments from international institutions, public funding alone is not the solution. The private sector will play a key role in providing the necessary additional resources. With appropriate information all can contribute to increasing the resilience of local communities. The Global Adaptation Index™ (GaIn™) is a navigation chart that can guide investments both private and public.\n\n\n### Two Key Dimensions to Adapt\n\n###Overview Diagram\n\n#### Vulnerability\n\nVulnerability seeks to capture exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. 3 categories represent the core components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, capacity), and 6 key sector indicators (Water, Food and Agriculture, Health, Coastal Protection, Energy and Transport) for each\ncategory.\n\n#### Readiness\n\nReadiness measures how well countries can respond to slow challenges (impact of changing temperatures on crops, growing water shortages) and sudden natural disasters (floods, tornados, earthquakes)."
