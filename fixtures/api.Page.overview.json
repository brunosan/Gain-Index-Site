Indicators to score both \"Vulnerability\" and \"Readiness\" were selected through a deliberative consultation process.</p><p></p>\n\n<p>The Vulnerability Axis seeks to capture exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. The vulnerability analysis uses twenty-four indicators to measure three sectors that underlie human well-being (water, food and health). These sectors are enhanced by measuring infrastructure indicators (coastal, energy and transport).</p><p></p>\n\n<p>The Readiness Axis seeks to measure the ability of a country’s private and public sectors to absorb additional investment resources and apply them effectively towards increasing resiliency to climate change and other global forces. There are three categories of readiness indicators: economic, social and governance.</p>"
