    "body": "Welcome to the data browser for The Global Adaptation Index™ (GaIn™). This site is devoted to visualizing and exploring data concerning countries' susceptibility to the effects of climate change and their preparedness to undertake adaptive actions to climate change. Powered by completely open data, thirty-eight raw indicators are used to calculate the GaIn™ score of a country, which is intended to represent the overall status of a country with respect to climate change. \n\n(Image placeholder)\n\n##The Core of GaIn™: Readiness and Vulnerability\n\nThe Global Adaptation Index™ hinges on two primary sub-indices: Readiness and Vulnerability. The readiness score of a country represents the country's overall preparedness to adapt to problems posed by climate change. It is calculated using 14 indicators, primarily drawn from the [Index of Economic Freedom](http://www.heritage.org/index/) and [World Governance Indicators](http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.asp). The vulnerability score captures a country's exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. Vulnerability takes 24 indicators to score countries on three critical aspects of human flourishing: food, water and health, and augments this analysis with a country infrastructure score as well. \n\n##Site Design\n\nThis site is designed for easy access and analysis of The Global Adaptation Index™, serving the interests of both the public and private sectors. The front page exposes GaIn results on a world wide scale, for instant geographic visualization and comparability. The rankings page demonstrates how countries are faring with respect to every indicator and allows for in-depth country specific analysis by linking to country pages. The Readiness Matrix™ allows worldwide comparisons of vulnerability and readiness scores simultaneously. The rest of the about section delves into the methods and working assumptions behind this data, as well as provide greater explanations of the hierarchical structure of the data sets.\n\n##Actionable Information\n\nThe results of The Global Adaptation Index™ are intended to motivate real progressive change in response to climate change. While the results can be used for many purposes, one primary such purpose is to inform pragmatic investment decision making in the public and private sectors. Low GaIn™ scores indicate countries that need support from governments and non-profit organizations to build and strengthen their infrastructure and ecosystems against climate change. Countries with high GaIn™ scores provide safe economies for private companies to fund research and social programs to develop better strategies to combat climate change. These two inferences only scratch the surface of the actionable information GaIn provides, especially as deeper analysis into specific components, sectors and indicators reveals more industry and issue specific concerns within countries. GaIn™ provides a tool for real institutions to take immediate and informed steps towards combating the threats of climate change."
