    "body": "The Global Adaptation Index™ (GAIN™), a project of the [Global Adaption Institute](http://globalai.org/), provides a data-driven approach to help countries and the private sector invest in adaptation to climate change and other global forces. \n\nClimate change is a reality and the challenge is only increasing as population growth, urbanization and economic expansion continue. All countries must adapt in order to minimize the effects of climate change and other global forces. Despite expanding resource commitments from international institutions, public funding alone is not the solution. The private sector will play a key role in providing the necessary additional resources. GAIN offers information on a country's vulnerability and its readiness to undertake adaptive actions to prioritize and evaluate these needed investments.\n\n### Two Key Dimensions to Adapt\n\n###Overview Diagram\n\n#### Vulnerability\n\nGAIN vulnerability analysis seeks to capture exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. GAIN uses 24 indicators to measure three sectors that underlie human well-being (water, food and health) and three infrastructure sectors (coastal, energy and transport).\n\n#### Readiness\n\nReadiness seeks to measure the ability of a country to successfully absorb additional private sector investment resources and apply them effectively toward increasing resiliency to climate change and other global challenges. 14 indicators are used to measure three categories of readiness: economic, social and governance.\n"
