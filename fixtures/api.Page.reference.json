Please feel free to [send us](email://gain@globalai.org) comments or further material.\n\n###Vulnerability\n\n* [Adaptation investments: a resource allocation framework](http://www.springerlink.com/content/f07067w33863x781/). Additional finance for adaptation is an important element of the emerging international climate change framework. This paper discusses how adaptation funding may be allocated among developing countries in a transparent, efficient and equitable way. We propose an approach based on three criteria: the climate change impacts experienced in a country, a country’s adaptive capacity and its implementation capacity. Physical impact and adaptive capacity together determine a country’s vulnerability to climate change.\n\n* [Coping with Global Climate Change. The Role of Adaptation in the United States](http://www.pewclimate.org/docUploads/Adaptation.pdf). Climate change resulting from increased greenhouse gas concentrations has the potential to harm societies and ecosystems. In particular, agriculture, forestry, water resources, human health, coastal settlements, and natural ecosystems will need to adapt to a changing climate or face diminished functions.\n\n* [Climate Change: Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation in Developing Countries](http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/impacts.pdf). This book highlights the concerns and needs of developing countries in adapting to the effects of climate change.  It outlines the impact of climate change in four developing country regions:  Africa, Asia, Latin America and small island developing States the vulnerability of these regions to future climate change current adaptation plans, strategies and actions and future adaptation options and needs.\n\n* [Climate Vulnerability Monitor](http://daraint.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/CVM_Complete.pdf). Climate change is the most urgent challenge of our time. The future of the environment and the life it supports rests on the decisions we take over the coming years. This represents an enormous responsibility on our shoulders, which is not only a burden -- but also a tremendous opportunity for us all.\n\n* [Sudan, Yemen Ranked Near Top of Bloomberg Combustibility Index](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-11/sudan-yemen-ranked-near-top-of-bloomberg-combustibility-index.html ). Sudan, Yemen and Syria are among the nations most prone to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, trailing only Libya in a ranking of 20 countries in the Bloomberg Combustibility Index.\n\n* [The World Economic Forum Global Risks Report and Public Health](http://umrscblogs.org/2011/01/12/the-world-economic-forum-global-risks-report-and-public-health/). Global Risks 2011 (the World Economic Forum's report), one of the most influential publications in raising awareness on emerging global issues and possible solutions, focuses on three specific risk-clusters that have emerged over the past few years, covering macroeconomic imbalances, illegal economies, and food, water and energy.  Of these, the “water-food-energy nexus” has perhaps the greatest potential to impact on public health if not addressed effectively.\n\n* [The determinants of vulnerability and adaptive capacity at the national level and the implications for adaptation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378004000913). We present a set of indicators of vulnerability and capacity to adapt to climate variability, and by extension climate change, derived using a novel empirical analysis of data aggregated at the national level on a decadal timescale. The analysis is based on a conceptual framework in which risk is viewed in terms of outcome, and is a function of physically defined climate hazards and socially constructed vulnerability.\n\n* [Developing Credible Vulnerability Indicators for Climate Adaptation Policy Assessment](https://springerlink3.metapress.com/content/kr6481642w504335/resource-secured/?target=fulltext.pdf&sid=2yl1hv45sn2osz450skykb55&sh=www.springerlink.com). We address the issue of how to develop credible indicators of vulnerability to climate change that can be used to guide the development of adaptation policies. We compare the indicators and measures that five past national-level studies have used and examine how and why their approaches have differed. Other relevant indicator studies of social facets of society as well as vulnerability studies at sub-national level are also examined for lessons regarding best practice. We find that the five studies generally emphasise descriptive measures by aggregating environmental and social conditions. \n\n* [The State of Food Insecurity in the World](http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1683e/i1683e.pdf). The number of undernourished people in the world remains unacceptably high at near the one billion mark despite an expected decline in 2010 for the first time since 1995. This decline is largely attributable to increased economic growth foreseen in 2010 – particularly in developing countries – and the fall in international food prices since 2008. The recent increase in food prices, if it persists, will create additional obstacles in the fight to further reduce hunger.\n\n* [Which Nations Are Most Vulnerable to Climate Change? The Daunting Politics of Choosing](http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2011/02/24/24climatewire-which-nations-are-most-vulnerable-to-climate-95690.html). 'Is it worse to be swallowed by the sea or racked by famine?\nAs climate change tightens its grip on the world, institutions charged with protecting the most vulnerable nations could be faced with just such a question. Because there is no international consensus for ranking the possibilities of future devastation -- and because there are limited dollars lined up to help cope with climate change -- some countries already are battling over who will be considered most vulnerable.\n\n* [How inequitable is the global distribution of responsibility, capability, and vulnerability to climate change: A comprehensive indicator-based assessment](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378010000683). While it is generally asserted that those countries who have contributed least to anthropogenic climate change are most vulnerable to its adverse impacts some recently developed indices of vulnerability to climate change come to a different conclusion. Confirmation or rejection of this assertion is complicated by the lack of an agreed metric for measuring countries’ vulnerability to climate change and by conflicting interpretations of vulnerability.\n\n* [GLOBAL CLIMATE RISK INDEX 2011: WHO SUFFERS MOST FROM EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS? WEATHER-RELATED LOSS EVENTS IN 2009 AND 1990 TO 2009](http://www.germanwatch.org/klima/cri2011.pdf). 'As in previous years, the Global Climate Risk Index 2011 analyses to what extent countries have been affected by the impacts of weather_related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.). The most recent available data from 2009 as well as for the period 1990-2009 were taken into account.\n\n* [Climate change vulnerability and adaptation indicators ETCACC Technical Paper 2008/9](http://acm.eionet.europa.eu/docs/ETCACC_TP_2008_9_CCvuln_adapt_indicators.pdf). A major contemporary issue for policy and decision-makers is to understand and address the projected impacts of climate change and the related vulnerability of environmental, social, and economic systems. There is also a growing demand from stakeholders to share information on good practice in adapting to climate change impacts and to measure progress and effectiveness of resource commitments. Clarity over the primary purpose of such monitoring activity is crucial to guide the development of appropriate indicators.\n\n\n* [“Indicators of vulnerability and adaptive capacity”: Towards a clarification of the science–policy interface](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378010000750). The issue of ‘‘measuring’’ climate change vulnerability and adaptive capacity by means of indicators divides policy and academic communities. While policy increasingly demands such indicators an increasing body of literature criticises them. This misfit results from a twofold confusion. First, there is confusion about what vulnerability indicators are and which arguments are available for building them. Second, there is confusion about the kinds of policy problems to be solved by means of indicators. This paper addresses both sources of confusion.\n\n* [Identifying Countries that are Particularly Vulnerable to the Adverse Effects of Climate Change: An Academic or a Political Challenge?](http://www.ask-eu.com/Default.asp?Menue=118&Bereich=1&SubBereich=3&KW=0&ArtikelPPV=16017). 'The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) commits developed countries “to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects” (Article 4.4). Ever since the Convention was agreed in 1992, the question has arisen of what it means to be “particularly vulnerable”, and how it is decided which countries fall into this category.\n\n* [Assessing Progress on Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation in Development Processes](http://community.eldis.org/.59e0d267/Convergence.pdf). 'Climate change threatens development and the progress needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. With shifting seasons, increasing water scarcity, and potentially more frequent and intense extreme events (IPCC 2007), climate change is bringing a series of disaster and livelihood impacts to the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities, and is placing development assistance at risk.\n\n* [Assessing the vulnerability of food crop systems in Africa to climate change ](http://www.springerlink.com/content/a40403n4777730x3/). Africa is thought to be the region most vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change. Agriculture plays a dominant role in supporting rural livelihoods and economic growth over most of Africa. Three aspects of the vulnerability of food crop systems to climate change in Africa are discussed: the assessment of the sensitivity of crops to variability in climate, the adaptive capacity of farmers, and the role of institutions in adapting to climate change. The magnitude of projected impacts of climate change on food crops in Africa varies widely among different studies.\n\n* [VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE: A Quantitative Approach](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/data/publications/Vulnerability_to_Climate_Change.PDF). The PNNL Vulnerability Assessment Program explores approaches for assessing the significance of potential future changes in climate for natural resources and socioeconomic systems. Research on vulnerability addresses two important challenges identified in the recent impact assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Watson et al. 1996, 1998, McCarthy et al. 2001). The first challenge is to improve approaches for comparing and aggregating impacts across diverse sectors and populations.\n\n* [The Water Poverty Index: Development and application at the community scale](ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/emailconf/wfe2005/narf_054.pdf). The article details the development and uses of the water poverty index (WPI). The index was developed as a holistic tool to measure water stress at the household and community levels, designed to aid national decision makers, at community and central government level, as well as donor agencies, to determine priority needs for interventions in the water sector. The index combines into a single number a cluster of data directly and indirectly relevant to water stress.\n\n* [The Climate Vulnerability Index: relevance to the Tourism Sector](http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/news/events/ccamts/appendix06.pdf). \n\n* [Social Vulnerability to Climate Variability Hazards: A Review of the Literature'](http://adapt.oxfamamerica.org/resources/Literature_Review.pdf).There is a rich multidisciplinary tradition that examines risk, hazards and disasters.Hazards are threats that have the potential to harm people (and the things they value) and places. Risk is the likelihood of incurring harm, or the probability that some type of injury or loss would result from the hazard event. Disasters are singular larger scale events that overwhelm the local capacity to effectively respond to and recover from an event (NRC 2006). Hazards and disasters have many origins, but we normally view them as caused by the interaction between society and natural systems (e.g. hurricanes), between society and technology (e.g. chemical spills), or within society itself (e.g. civil strife). \n\n* [Water Scarcity Index](http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article77.html)Water overuse is damaging the environment in many major basins. High overuse tends to occur in regions heavily dependent on irrigated agriculture and in areas undergoing rapid urbanization and industrial development. An estimated 1.4 billion people now live in river basin areas that are ‘closed’ (in that water use exceeds minimum recharge levels) or near closure. As millions of people in water-stressed areas are discovering, the environment is foreclosing on unsustainable water debts on an extensive scale. Some people in water-stressed areas have the economic resources, skills and opportunities to leave their water problem behind. Many millions, such as small farmers, agricultural laborers and pastoralists in poor countries, do not (Human Development Report 2006).\n\n* [Environmental Vulnerability Index](http://www.vulnerabilityindex.net/Files/EVI%20Final%20Report%202005.pdf)'\nA vulnerability index for the natural environment, the basis of all human welfare, has been developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and their partners. The index was developed through consultation and collaboration with countries, institutions and experts across the globe. This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.\n\n* [Environmental Water Scarcity Index by Basin  Watersheds of the World : Global Maps](http://multimedia.wri.org/watersheds_2003/gm16.html)'There is a growing awareness that increased water use by humans does not only reduce the amount of water available for industrial and agricultural development but has a profound effect on aquatic ecosystems and their dependent species. Human activities have severely affected the condition of freshwater ecosystems, to a point where many freshwater species are facing rapid population declines or extinction.\n\n\n* [Quantifying Vulnerability to Climate Change: Implications for Adaptation Assistance](http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1424759).\nThis paper attempts a comprehensive accounting of climate change vulnerability for 233 states. Using the most recent evidence, it develops risk indicators for three critical problems: increasing weather-related disasters, sea-level rise, and loss of agricultural productivity. The paper embeds these indicators in a methodology for cost-effective allocation of adaptation assistance. The methodology can be applied easily and consistently to all 233 states and all three problems, or to any subset that may be of interest to particular donors. Institutional perspectives and priorities differ the paper develops resource allocation formulas for three cases: (1) potential climate impacts alone, as measured by the three indicators (2) case 1 adjusted for differential country vulnerability, which is affected by economic development and governance and (3) case 2 adjusted for donor concerns related to project economics: inter country differences in project unit costs and probabilities of project success. The paper is accompanied by an Excel database with complete data for all 233 countries. \n\n###Readiness\n\n* [Environmental Performance Index 2010](http://epi.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/0157/epi2010_report.pdf). Environmental sustainability has emerged as a critical policy focus across the world. While a great deal of attention has recently been focused on climate change, other issues including water quality and availability, air pollution, deforestation and land use changes, biodiversity, the sustainability of agriculture and fisheries have gained prominence on the public agenda.\n\n* [Global Competitiveness](http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-competitiveness). The World Economic Forum’s Centre for Global Competitiveness and Performance, through its Global Competitiveness Report and report series, aims to mirror the business operating environment and competitiveness of over 130 economies worldwide.\n\n* [INDICATORS AS A TECHNOLOGY OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE](http://www.iilj.org/publications/documents/2010-2.Davis-Kingsbury-Merry.pdf). The use of indicators is a prominent feature of contemporary global governance. Indicators are produced by organizations ranging from public actors such as the World Bank or the US State Department, to NGOs such as Freedom House, to hybrid entities such as the Global Fund, to private sector political risk rating agencies. They are used to compare and rank states for purposes as varied as deciding how to allocate foreign aid or investment and whether states have complied with their treaty obligations.\n\n* [Climate Resilient Infrastructure: Preparing for a Changing Climate](http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/climate-resilient-infrastructure-full.pdf). 'Alongside the transition to a low carbon society, increasing infrastructure’s resilience to climate change impacts is a high priority for this Government, to help protect the economy and its future growth.\nThis document has been produced as a response to calls from industry – infrastructure owners, investors and insurers – for a Government vision and policy on adapting infrastructure to climate change. It is designed to catalyse action to adapt infrastructure in the energy, ICT, transport and water sectors (infrastructure networks).\n\n\n* [Economic Freedom of the World. 2010 Annual Report](http://www.freetheworld.com/2010/reports/world/EFW2010_BOOK.pdf). 'The index published in Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) is designed to measure the consistency of a nation’s institutions and policies with this concept of self-ownership. The four cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange coordinated by markets,freedom to enter and compete in markets, protection of persons and their property from aggression by others.\n\n* [Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change](http://climatechange.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/documents/EACCSynthesisReport.pdf). As developing countries weigh how best to revitalize their economies and craft a sustainable development path to boost living standards, they will have to factor in the reality that the global annual average temperature is expected to be 2º C above pre-industrial levels by 2050. A 2º warmer world will experience more intense rainfall and more frequent and more intense droughts, floods, heat waves, and other extreme weather events. As a result, it will have dramatic implications for how countries manage their economies, care for their people and design their development paths.\n\n* [Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)](http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/resources.htm). 'The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project\nreports aggregate and individual governance indicators for 213 economies over the period 1996–2009, for six dimensions of governance: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, Control of Corruption.\n\n* [Capital Access Index 2008: Best Markets for Business Access to Capital](http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&ID=38801195&cat=resrep). 'The Capital Access Index ranks countries around the world in terms of the financial infrastructures that support entrepreneurial activity by providing access to capital. The index is unique in the breadth of economic factors and financial instruments that are analyzed and its reliance on quantitative, not qualitative, data.\n\n* [Big Mac Index](http://www.economist.com/markets/bigmac/index.cfm). 'The Economist's Big Mac index seeks to make exchange-rate theory more digestible. It is arguably the world's most accurate financial indicator to be based on a fast-food item.\nBurgernomics is based on the theory of purchasing-power parity, the notion that a dollar should buy the same amount in all countries. Thus in the long run, the exchange rate between two countries should move towards the rate that equalizes the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in each country. Our ''basket'' is a McDonald's Big Mac, which is produced in about 120 countries. The Big Mac PPP is the exchange rate that would mean hamburgers cost the same in America as abroad. Comparing actual exchange rates with PPPs indicates whether a currency is under- or overvalued.'\n\n* [2011 Index of Economic Freedom](http://www.heritage.org/index/). Economic freedom advanced this year, regaining much of the momentum lost during the fiscal crisis and global recession. Many governments around the world have rededicated themselves to fiscal sound- ness, openness and reform, and the majority of countries are once again on a positive path to greater freedom.\nThe 2011 Index of Economic Freedom reports on economic policy developments since the second half of 2009 in 183 economies. Based on 10 measures that evaluate openness, the rule of law, and competitiveness, the Index ranks economies according to their economic freedom. The principles of economic freedom emphasized in the Index are individual empowerment, non-discimination, and the promotion of competition.'\n\n\n\n\n* [The Human Development Index (HDI)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/)'The first Human Development Report introduced a new way of measuring development by combining indicators of life expectancy, educational attainment and income into a composite human development index, the HDI. The education component of the HDI is now measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and expected years of schooling for children of school going age. Mean years of schooling is estimated based on duration of schooling at each level of education (for details see Barro and Lee, 2010). Expected years of schooling estimates are based on enrolment by age at all levels of education and population of official school age for each level of education. \n\n* [The Human Poverty Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/indices/hpi/)If human development is about enlarging choices, poverty means that opportunities and choices most basic to human development are denied. Thus a person is not free to lead a long, healthy, and creative life and is denied access to a decent standard of living, freedom, dignity, self-respect and the respect of others. From a human development perspective, poverty means more than the lack of what is necessary for material well-being.\n\n\n\n###Adaptation in General\n\n\n* [Adaptation Science Should Be Applied to Climate Change, Scientists Urge](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100120085350.htm). The urgency for adaptation actions in response to climate risks is rapidly growing -- climate change mitigation efforts alone are insufficient to avoid further and often negative impacts. Although most farmers respond rapidly to changes in their external environment, science needs to play an important role in instigating adaptation actions that go beyond the ongoing, experienced-based individual responses. Effective adaptation action requires 'adaptation science', a holistic way of scientific conduct.\n\n* [Adapting to Climate Change. Facing the consequences](http://www.economist.com/node/17572735). The world warmed by about 0.7°C in the 20th century. Every year in this century has been warmer than all but one in the last (1998, since you ask). If carbon-dioxide levels were magically to stabilize where they are now (almost 390 parts per million, 40% more than before the industrial revolution) the world would probably warm by a further half a degree or so as the ocean, which is slow to change its temperature, caught up. But CO2 levels continue to rise.\n\n* [Adapting for a Green Economy: Companies, Communities and Climate Change](http://www.oxfamamerica.org/files/adapting-for-a-green-economy-updated.pdf). Twenty years ago, world leaders gathered at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and signed the first global agreement to tackle climate change. At the time, the impacts of climate change on communities and economies were just beginning to be understood, and the role of the private sector in responding to these challenges was only just emerging. But two decades later, climate change is no longer a distant threat looming on the horizon it has emerged as arguably the greatest global challenge of our time.\n\n* [Opportunities for Private Sector Engagement in Urban Climate Change Resilience Building](http://www.intellecap.com/assets/84/Private_Sector_Engagement_in_UCCRB_-_Final.pdf). Global rise in temperature has been steep in the last 50 years, leading to increased climatic variability. This variability manifests itself in various ways including through unpredictable rainfall patterns, increased flooding, depleting agricultural output and rising sea-levels. Although efforts are in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate future rise in temperature, responding to the inevitable impacts of climate change that we are already witnessing has received relatively less attention.\n\n* [Living Planet Report 2010. Biodiversity, Biocapacity and Development](http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/). 'The protection of biodiversity and ecosystems must be a priority in our quest to build a stronger, fairer and cleaner world economy. Rather than an excuse to delay further action, the recent financial and economic crisis should serve as a reminder of the urgency of developing greener economies. Both WWF and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are contributing to this goal.\n\n* [The World Health Report 2000 - Health Systems: Improving Performance](http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf). Today and every day, the lives of vast numbers of people lie in the hands of health systems. From the safe delivery of a healthy baby to the care with dignity of the frail elderly, health systems have a vital and continuing responsibility to people throughout the lifespan. They are crucial to the healthy development of individuals, families and societies everywhere.\n\n* [Mortality rate, under-5 (per 1,000)](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT). Under-five mortality rate is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn baby will die before reaching age five, if subject to current age-specific mortality rates.\n\n* [Hacia la Evaluación de Prácticas de Adaptación ante la Variabilidad y el Cambio Climático](NULL). En la actualidad, los países de América Latina y el Caribe enfrentan un reto de proporciones nunca antes presentado un cambio en los patrones climáticos asociado a un futuro incierto y poco alentador. Ante este panorama, la adaptación surge como una estrategia necesaria a distintos niveles y escalas, como complemento de los esfuerzos para la mitigación del cambio climático.\n\n* [Water Security: The Water-Food-Energy-Climate Nexus](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_WI_WaterSecurity_WaterFoodEnergyClimateNexus_2011.pdf). Water security is the gossamer that links together the web of food, energy, climate, economic growth, and human security challenges that the world economy faces over the next two decades.\nThere is a structural problem in how we manage water across the web of our global economy. Unless it is checked, worsening water security will soon tear into various parts of the global economic system. It will start to emerge as a headline geopolitical issue. The increasing volatility in food prices in 2008, 2009 and again in 2010 should be treated as early warning signs of what is to come.\n\n* [Evaluating Climate Change and Development](NULL). 'Climate change has become one of the most important global issues of our time, with far-reaching natural, socio-economic, and political effects. To address climate change and development issues from the perspective of evaluation, an international conference was held in Alexandria, Egypt. This book distills the essence of that timely conference, building on the experiences of more than 400 reports and studies presented.\n\n* [IUPA: a tool for the evaluation of the general usefulness of practices for adaptation to climate change and variability](http://www.springerlink.com/content/xk46r58546p11763/). A prototype multi-purpose index is proposed for use in the evaluation of practices for adaptation to climate variability and change. The Index of Usefulness of Practices for Adaptation (IUPA) allows the user to assign weights and scores to a set of user-defined evaluation criteria. Individual criterion scores are aggregated into a final index value. Both the final value and the individual parameter scores provide useful information for improved decision making in the context of climate change.\n\n\n* [Forest and Water Climate Adaptation: A case study for sumner county Tennessee](http://www.cakex.org/sites/default/files/Sumner-County-TN-Case-Study-2010.pdf). In 2010, the Model Forest Policy Program (MFPP), the Cumberland River Compact, and Sumner County came together to create a climate adaptation plan for the community of Sumner County. It came about because MFPP recognized the critical need for local community resilience against the impacts of climate change by protecting forest and water resources. This climate adaptation plan for Sumner County, Tennessee presents the results of a year of community team effort, deep and broad information gathering, critical analysis and thoughtful planning.\n\n* [Development and climate change : review and quantitative analysis of indices of climate change exposure, adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and impacts](http://climatechange.worldbank.org/climatechange/node/5325). 'Climate change is expected to hit developing countries the hardest. Its effects—higher temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and more frequent weather-related disasters—pose risks for agriculture, food, and water supplies. At stake are recent gains in the fight against poverty, hunger and disease, and the lives and livelihoods of billions of people in developing countries. Adaptation to climate change is necessary, in addition to mitigation of climate change, to avoid unacceptable impacts of anthropogenic climate change.\n\n* [Big economies of the future - Bangladesh, India, Philippines, Vietnam and Pakistan - most at risk from climate change](http://maplecroft.com/about/news/ccvi.html). 'A new global ranking, calculating the vulnerability of 170 countries to the impacts of climate change over the next 30 years, identifies some of the world’s largest and fastest-growing economies, including India, as facing the greatest risks to their populations, ecosystems and business environments. \n\n* [Defining Climate Compatible Development](http://www.cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/CDKN-CCD-DIGI-MASTER-19NOV.pdf). '`Climate compatible development’ is development that minimizes the harm caused by climate impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a low emissions, more resilient, future. Climate change and responses to it are changing patterns of innovation, trade, production, population distribution and risk in complex ways. This is creating a new development landscape for policy makers, who need to nurture and sustain economic growth and social development in the face of multiple threats and uncertainties while also cutting emissions or keeping them low.\n\n* [Climate change adaptation indicators for the natural environment](http://naturalengland.etraderstores.com/NaturalEnglandShop/NECR038). 'This project aims to identify a package of process and outcome indicators. In practice, this means identifying indicators which measure the process of planning for climate change and the characteristics of a resilient natural environment (as a proxy for measuring the outcome of adaptation)\n\n* [Growth re-imagined – Prospects in emerging markets drive CEO confidence](http://www.pwc.ch/user_content/editor/files/publ_corp/pwc_14th_annual_global_ceo_survey1_e.pdf). 'The divergence within the global economy is one of the main reasons why most CEOs (84%) say they’ve changed their company strategy in the past two years – with a third of them describing the change as ‘fundamental’. Only half the world is growing at a robust rate. Although the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts global growth at 4.2% for 2011, developed countries – which make up 52% of the world economy – are growing at only half that pace. In contrast, emerging markets are booming, with Indonesia, India and China all forecast to grow faster than 6%.1\n\n* [PLACE II: Population, Landscape, and Climate Estimates](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/place/). Version two of the Population, Landscape, and Climate Estimates data set, PLACE II, has been released as part of SEDAC’s National Aggregates of Geospatial Data Collection. The aim is to provide country-level measures of spatial characteristics of 228 nations to researchers for whom national aggregates are more useful than GIS data.\n\n* [Climate Finance.

'This book is the first volume of policy papers issuing from the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute. It demonstrates NYU Abu Dhabi’s commitment to scholarship on matters that have critical significance in the world today. And we consider it fitting, with the selection of Abu Dhabi as home for the International Renewable Energy Agency and the ground-breaking work of Masdar, that this volume tackles one of the most pressing global issues: climate change.\n\n* [A Survey of Composite Indices Measuring Country Performance: 2008 Update](http://www.undp.org/developmentstudies/docs/indices_2008_bandura.pdf). 'The aim of the survey is to identify indices that rank or assess country performance in a diverse set of topics including competitiveness, governance, social aspects, human rights, the environment, security and globalization, amongst others. Indices taken for consideration in this survey cover either a particular set of countries (such as a geographical region or income group) or all countries in the world, where data is available.\n\n* [Compendium on methods and tools to evaluate impacts of, vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change](http://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/nairobi_workprogramme/compendium_on_methods_tools/application/pdf/20080307_compendium_m_t_complete.pdf)'This updated compendium is organized in a way that allows existing adaptation analysis and decision frameworks and tools to be catalogued in manner that is clear and easy to use and does not prescribe or recommend methods or tools. Whereas the original compendium for the most part organized discrete adaptation decision tools according to sectors of application, echoing the sectoral model based approach to vulnerability and adaptation assessment of the time, the organization of this revised compendium reflects the expanded scope and comprehensiveness of methods currently in use.\n\n* [Global threats to human water security and river biodiversity](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7315/full/nature09440.html) Protecting the world’s freshwater resources requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from global to local. Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80% of the world’s population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65% of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity\n\n\n\n* [Ratings Ladder](http://www.bradynet.com/e870.html). \n\n\n* [Environmental Sustainability Index](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/es/esi/ESI2005.pdf). 'The Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) benchmarks the ability of nations to protect the environment over the next several decades. It does so by integrating 76 data sets – track- ing natural resource endowments, past and present pollution levels, environmental management efforts, and the capacity of a society to improve its environmental performance – into 21 indicators of environmental sustain- ability. These indicators permit comparison across a range of issues that fall into the following five broad categories: Environmental Systems, Reducing Environmental Stresses, Reducing Human Vulnerability to Environmental Stresses, Societal and Institutional Capacity to Respond to Environmental Challenges , Global Stewardship.\n\n* [Global Temperature Records]( http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info/warming/) 'Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.\nMost of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. This is an advance since the TAR's conclusion that ''most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations''. Discernible human influences now extend to other aspects of climate, including ocean warming, continental-average temperatures, temperature extremes and wind patterns.\n\n* [Capacity strengthening in climate change vulnerability and adaptation strategy assessments](http://c3d-unitar.org/c3d/userfiles/Guide_for_trainers.pdf) 'This manual is intended to guide and support trainers whose activities seek to support and strengthen capacities of participants in the UNFCCC process, particularly in the domain of vulnerability and adaptation. This training of trainers’ manual is one of the components of the Climate Change Capacity Development (C3D) project a project jointly implemented by ENDA-TM (Dakar), the Energy Research Centre (ERC, Cape Town), the Munasinghe Institute for Development (MIND, Colombo) and UNITAR (Geneva).'\n"
