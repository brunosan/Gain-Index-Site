    "body": "The final GaIn™ score of a country reflects aggregated scores at several different levels. Below is a top-down explanation of every score used to calculate the GaIn™ score, from the two primary indexes, vulnerability and readiness, to the raw data themselves. The page ends with an explanation of the assumptions and methods used to convert the raw data into the scores that comprise sector and component values. \n\n## GaIn™\n\nThe GaIn™ score serves as an overall measure of a country's vulnerability to climate-related hazards and its readiness to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change. It is calculated as the readiness score of a country minus its vulnerability score, which is then scaled to a score between 0 and 100 for ease of communication.\n\n## Vulnerability\n\nVulnerability seeks to capture exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. Vulnerability is analyzed in two different ways: (1) by three core components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, capacity), and (2) by four key sector indicators (water, food, health and infrastructure). For three sectors (water, food and health), qualitative and quantitative types of measures are incorporated. Quantitative measures include things like amount, how much is used, how many people have access, while qualitative measures include things like exposure to poor quality, impacts on people and access to quality management measures. Infrastructure comprises three key areas: energy, coasts and transportation, and is composed of only quantitative indicators. Vulnerability scores are calculated by taking the mean of the four sector scores and each sector and component score is calculated by taking the mean of their respective indicator scores. \n\n### Components\n\n#### Capacity\n\nCapacity measures the availability of economic, social and institutional resources to cope with and adapt to the impacts of climate change, which is composed of:\n\n* Food capacity\n* Life expectancy\n* Malnutrition\n* Maternal mortality\n* Sanitary water\n* Water access\n\n#### Exposure\n\nThe exposure score measures the likelihood of climate-related hazards within a country based on the following indicators:\n\n* Coastal area\n* Disability adjusted life years\n* Disease mortality\n* Precipitation change\n* Projected yield change\n* Road flooding\n* Temperature change\n* Yield change\n\n#### Sensitivity\n\nSensitivity determines the potential severity of the impacts of climate-related threats in a nation. It is comprised of the following indicators:\n\n* Coastal population\n* Energy sensitivity\n* Food import dependency\n* Health workers per capita\n* Paved roads\n* Rural population\n* Water disease\n* Water use\n\n### Sectors\n\n#### Food\n\nThe food score measures a nation's food production, nutrition and rural population. Specifically, it is comprised of:\n\n* Food capacity\n* Food import dependency\n* Malnutrition\n* Projected yield change\n* Rural population\n* Variation of cereal yield\n\n#### Health\n\nThis sector measures a nation's ability to provide health services against several mortality and life expectancy statistics, namely:\n\n* Disability adjusted life years\n* Disease mortality\n* External dependence\n* Health workers per capita\n* Life expectancy\n* Maternal mortality\n\n#### Infrastructure\n\nThe infrastructure sector analyzes three direct factors impacting human well-being in the face of climate change: coasts, energy and transportation, with the following indicators:\n\n* Coastal area\n* Coastal population\n* Energy access\n* Energy sensitivity\n* Paved roads\n* Road flooding\n\n\n#### Water\n\nThe water score measures a nation's current and future ability to provide clean water, calculated using the following indicators:\n\n* Temperature change\n* Precipitation change\n* Sanitary water\n* Water access\n* Water disease\n* Water use\n\n## Readiness\n\nReadiness seeks to measure the ability of a country’s private and public sectors to absorb additional investment resources and apply them effectively towards increasing resiliency to climate change. The axis has 3 categories of readiness: economic, social, and governance, and draws heavily on the commonly used measures found in the Index of Economic Freedom and World Governance Indicators. Readiness scores are calculated by summing component scores on the following weighted scale: 40% economic, 30% governance and 30% social. \n\n### Components\n\n#### Economic\n\n(40 %)\n\nThe economic readiness of a nation reflects its economic stability  and governmental regulation of crucial economic freedoms. It is calculated by taking the equally-weighted sum of the following indicators:\n\n* Business freedom (5.71%)\n* Financial freedom (5.71%)\n* Fiscal freedom (5.71%)\n* Government spending (5.71%)\n* Investment freedom (5.71%)\n* Monetary freedom (5.71%)\n* Trade freedom (5.71%)\n\n#### Governance\n\n(30%)\n\nGovernance measures the overall integrity of the governing body of a nation. Specifically, it focuses on the political stability of a nation, laws concerning freedom of speech and the accountability of the government, as well as the government's control of corruption, The are all weighted equally:\n\n* Control of corruption (10%)\n* Political stability and non-violence (10%)\n* Voice and accountability (10%)\n\n\n#### Social\n\n(30%)\n\nThe social component of readiness measures the social awareness and acceptance of the threats climate change poses and the ease with which society could be mobilized to respond to climate-related hazards. It is calculated using the weighted scores of the following indicators:\n\n* Labor freedom (10%)\n* Mobile penetration (5%)\n* Rule of law (10%)\n* Tertiary education (5%)\n\n## Scoring indicators\n\nThe final indicator score calculation relies on a few steps and assumptions that require explanation. Each indicator contains four files named:\n\n* Raw0\n* Raw\n* Input\n* Score\n\n###Raw0 / raw files\n\nThe raw0 indicator file comes directly from the source of the data itself, without any modification or augmentation. The raw file is essentially the raw0 file, except that some values have been added in where the country's value is obvious. (For example, Austria has no coast line, so the raw files for coastal population and area have scores of \"0\" added in for Austria to reflect this.) \n\n###Input files\n\nSome indicators are missing some time-series values for some countries in their raw files. The input file fills all blank cells by either interpolating or extrapolating from the values present in the raw files. Interpolation between points uses a positive linear function for the intermediate values. Extrapolation beyond the most current data imposes a penalty score of subtracting 2% of the score for each subsequent year that needs to be filled in. This is done to encourage countries to report their most recent data.\n\n###Score files\n\nThe scores of each indicator are normalized within a 0 - 1 range. Since the units of each indicator vary, indicator-specific functions convert every input value to a score between 0 and 1. Some indicators employ threshold limits on the input values, making every instance of input values beyond or below these thresholds automatically receive a score of \"1\" or \"0\". This is enforced as a kind of 'saturation' measure, serving as points beyond which a country's GaIn™ score should be neither boosted nor penalized for further gains or losses within a given indicator. It also accommodates for extreme outliers that would otherwise dramatically skew the conversion function.\n\n##Missing data\n\nSome countries are missing data for every year for a given indicator. So, if a country does not have any values in their raw files, they receive no input and, hence, no score value for that indicator. If enough indicators are missing scores for a country, then the corresponding the country receives no sector or component score. In the same vein, if enough sector or component scores are absent for a country, it will not receive the corresponding readiness or vulnerability score. Any country missing either a vulnerability or readiness score does not receive a GaIn™ score."
