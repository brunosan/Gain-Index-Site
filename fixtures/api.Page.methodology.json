Below is an explanation of every indicator (here called 'measures') used to calculate the GAIN Index, from vulnerability and readiness aggregations down to the raw data themselves. An explanation of the assumptions and methods used to convert the raw data into the scores that comprise sector and component values follows.</p>\n\nYou can also download a pdf version in <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4234369/gain/GaIn_Paper.pdf\">English</a> or <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4234369/gain/GaIn_Paper_Spanish.pdf\">Spanish</a>.\n\n<h2 id=\"gain\">GAIN</h2>\n\n<p>The GAIN Index serves as an overall measure of a country&#39;s vulnerability to climate-related hazards and its readiness to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change and other global forces. It is calculated as the readiness score of a country minus its vulnerability score, which is then scaled to a score between 0 and 100 for ease of communication.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"overviewdiagram\">Overview Diagram</h3>\n\n<p>GAIN trend is generated by assessing a country&#39;s movement (improvement or decline) on the GAIN Index over the average of the past three years compared to the average of the 3 years prior to that: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A Positive trend is shown when the improvement is better than the average. </li>\n<li>An Equal sign corresponds to positive improvements but below the average.</li>\n<li>A Negative trend corresponds to declining scores.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"vulnerability\">Vulnerability</h2>\n\n<p>The Vulnerability framework has two dimensions: (1) by three core components of vulnerability (exposure to climate-related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the capacity to cope with those impacts), and (2) by four key sector indicators (water, food, health and infrastructure). </p>\n\n<p>For three sectors (water, food and health), quality and quantity measures are incorporated. Quantity measures focus on amounts, how much is used and how many people have access. Quality measures consider factors such as exposure to poor quality, impacts on people and access to quality management measures. Infrastructure comprises three key areas: energy, coasts and transportation, and is composed of only quantity indicators. Vulnerability scores are calculated by taking the mean of the four sector scores and each sector and component score is calculated by taking the mean of their respective indicator scores. In the current vulnerability structure it happens that the formula leads to each measure having equal weight.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vulnerabilityindicatorsbysectorandcomponent\">Vulnerability indicators by

increasing resiliency to climate change. GAIN considers three categories of readiness: economic, social and governance.

Scores for each indicator involve four steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Raw0&quot;: Sourced data</li>\n<li>&quot;Raw&quot;: Raw0 data + safe assumptions</li>\n<li>&quot;Input&quot;: Data interpolations and extrapolations.</li>\n<li>&quot;Score&quot;: Scoring with thresholds applied.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can find corresponding files for each step in the <a href=\"/about/download\">Data download</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sourceddata\">Sourced data</h3>\n\n<p>These &quot;raw0&quot; values come directly from the source of the data itself, without any modification or augmentation. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"raw0datasafeassumptions\">Raw0 data + safe assumptions</h3>\n\n<p>&quot;raw&quot; values are essentially equal to raw0, plus those added in where the country&#39;s value is obvious. (For example, Austria has no coastline, so the raw files for coastal population and area have scores of &quot;0&quot; added in for Austria to reflect this.) </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"datainterpolationsandextrapolations\">Data Interpolations and extrapolations.</h3>\n\n<p>Measures are not reported for every year. The input file fills all blank cells by either interpolating or extrapolating from the values present in the raw files. Interpolation between points uses a linear function for the intermediate values. Extrapolation beyond the most current data, and before first reported data, are projected without variation. A yearly penalty score per extrapolated year could be implemented to emphasize the lack of reported data, but currently the penalty score is set to 0% per year.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scorefiles\">Score files</h3>\n\n<p>The scores of each indicator are normalized within a 0 - 1 range. Since the units and range of each indicator vary, a general function converts every input value to a score between 0 and 1.\nEach measure has threshold limits on the input values, giving every instance of input values beyond or below these thresholds automatically a score of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;. Usually the thresholds are set to encompass the full range of observed values, but sometimes a lower or higher threshold is set.  This &#39;saturation&#39; serves as points beyond which a country&#39;s score for each measure should be neither boosted nor penalized for further gains or losses within a given indicator. It also accommodates for extreme outliers that would otherwise dramatically skew the conversion function.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"saturationlevelsanddirection\">Saturation levels and Direction</h1>\n\n<table>\n\n <tr>\n  <td><b>Indicator</b></td><td><b>Lower threshold</b></td><td><b>Upper threshold</b></td><td><b>Direction</b></td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Projected proportional change in precipitation</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Internal and external freshwater water extracted for all uses (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td><td>100</td><td>1</td>\n</tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Population with access to improved water supply (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Projected change in temperature (deg C)</td>\n  <td>1.5</td>\n  <td>5.5</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Mortality (per 100,000) among under 5 yr-olds due to water-borne diseases</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>1500</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>% Population with access to improved sanitation</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Projected change (index) in agricultural (cereal) yield</td>\n  <td>-20</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>% rural population</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Agric Capacity (index based on access to farm mechanization, fertilizers and irrigation)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Coefficient of variation in cereal crop yields</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>0.5</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>    Food import dependency (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Children under 5 suffering from malnutrition (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>10</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Estimated impact of future climate change on deaths from disease (index based on DALYs)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>0.4</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Health workers per capita</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>25</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Longevity</td>\n  <td>35</td>\n  <td>85</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Mortality due to communicable (infectious) diseases (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>0.5</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Health expenditure derived from external resources (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Maternal mortality</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Land less than 5 m above sea-level (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Population living less than 5 m above sea-level (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Population with access to reliable electricity (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Energy at risk (index based on energy imports and hydropower generation)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Frequency of floods per unit area (index based on observed floods)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Paved roads (%)</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>IEF Business freedom</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Finance freedom</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Fiscal Freedom</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Government Spending</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Investment Freedom</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Monetary Freedom</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Trade Freedom</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>WGI Political Stability &amp; Non-Violence</td>\n  <td>-2.5</td>\n  <td>2.5</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>WGI Voice &amp; Accountability</td>\n  <td>-2.5</td>\n  <td>2.5</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>WGI Control of Corruption</td>\n  <td>-2.5</td>\n  <td>2.5</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Mobiles per 100 persons</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>90</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Tertiary Education</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>70</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>WGI Rule of Law</td>\n  <td>-2.5</td>\n  <td>2.5</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>Labor Freedom</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>IEF Property Rights</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td>100</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?

The reporting level drawer tracks the percentage of measures reported for each year, for the total 38 indicators. </p>\n\n<p>Our criteria to estimate missing data is explained above. However, if a country does not have any values in their raw files, we cannot estimate any input values. Hence, no score values are available for that measure. The corresponding country receives no sector or component score if any of its components is missing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We allow for up to 4 out of 24 measures to be missing in the Vulnerability Index. In these cases, the overall Vulnerability score is calculated with all available measures. If more than 4 measures are absent for a country, it will not receive the corresponding Vulnerability score, and therefore no GAIN score. Earlier analysis has shown that the broad ranking of countries is maintained with as many as a third of the measures missing.</p></li>\n<li><p>For Readiness, if one or more of the 14 measures are missing, the country receives no Readiness score and therefore no GAIN score.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"gdpcorrectedscores\">GDP Corrected Scores</h2>\n\n<p>There is a strong correlation between a country&#39;s GDP per capita and their GAIN and readiness scores and inverse correlation with vulnerability. To account for this relationship, each of the GAIN, vulnerability and readiness scores have corresponding &quot;GDP Adjusted&quot; scores as well.</p>\n\n<p>†: In what follows, GDP refers to Gross Domestic Product, per capita, measured with Purchasing Power Parity with International 2005 Dollars.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"readinessgdpcorrections\">Readiness GDP Corrections</h3>\n\n<p>We find a strong correlation between the Readiness Score and GDP. A Linear fit over all of the years yields a R^2 of 0.67, with the following parameters:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Expected Readiness = - 0.177 + 0.084  * Ln(GDP)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The &quot;GDP corrected Readiness&quot; corresponds to the distance of a country&#39;s measured readiness to the expected value for its GDP. Positive values reflect better (higher) readiness than expected.  In calculating the adjusted scores the regression and distance from the expected value is calculated on a year by year basis to allow for changes in the relationship over time.  These changes are quite small.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vulnerabilitygdpcorrections\">Vulnerability GDP Corrections</h3>\n\n<p>We find a high correlation between the Vulnerability Score and GDP.

Negative values reflect better (lower) vulnerability than expected.  Again, the calculations are done on a year by year basis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gaingdpcorrections\">GAIN GDP Corrections</h3>\n\n<p>We find a significant correlation between the GAIN Score and GDP. A Linear fit yields a R^2 of 0.77, with the following parameters:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Expected GAIN = 9.21 + 8.15 * Ln(GDP)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The &quot;GDP corrected GAIN&quot; corresponds to the distance of a country&#39;s measured GAIN score to the expected value for its GDP.
