    "body": "The final GaIn™ score of a country reflects aggregated scores at several different levels. Below is a top-down explanation of every score used to calculate the GaIn™ score, from the two primary indexes, vulnerability and readiness, to the raw data themselves. The page ends with an explanation of the assumptions and methods used to convert the raw data into the scores that comprise sector and component values. \n\n##GaIn™\n\nThe GaIn™ score serves as an overall measure of a country's vulnerability to climate-related hazards and its readiness to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change. It is calculated as the readiness score of a country minus its vulnerability score, which is then scaled to a score between 0 and 100 for ease of communication.\n\n##Vulnerability\n\nVulnerability seeks to capture exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. Vulnerability is analyzed in two different ways: (1) by three core components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, capacity), and (2) by four key sector indicators (water, food, health and infrastructure). For three sectors (water, food and health), qualitative and quantitative types of measures are incorporated. Quantitative measures include things like amount, how much is used, how many people have access, while qualitative measures include things like exposure to poor quality, impacts on people and access to quality management measures. Infrastructure comprises three key areas: energy, coasts and transportation, and is composed of only quantitative indicators. Vulnerability scores are calculated by taking the mean of the four sector scores and each sector and component score is calculated by taking the mean of their respective indicator scores. \n\n###Vulnerability indicators by sector and component\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>Variation of cereal yield</td><td class='exposure' rowspan='2'>Exposure</td><td class='food' rowspan='6'>Food</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Yield change</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Food import dependency</td><td class='sensitivity' rowspan='2'>Sensitivity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Rural population</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Food capacity</td><td class='capacity' rowspan='2'>Capacity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Malnutrition</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Precipitation change</td><td class='exposure' rowspan='2'>Exposure</td><td class='water' rowspan='6'>Water</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Temperature change</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Water disease</td><td class='sensitivity' rowspan='2'>Sensitivity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Water use</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Improved sanitation facilities</td><td class='capacity' rowspan='2'>Capacity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Water access</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Disability adjusted life years</td><td class='exposure' rowspan='2'>Exposure</td><td class='health' rowspan='6'>Health</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Disease mortality</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Health workers per capita</td><td class='sensitivity' rowspan='2'>Sensitivity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>External dependence</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Life expectancy</td><td class='capacity' rowspan='2'>Capacity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Maternal mortality</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Coastal area</td><td class='exposure' rowspan='3'>Exposure</td><td class='infrastructure' rowspan='6'>Infrastructure</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Energy access</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Road flooding</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Coastal population</td><td class='sensitivity' rowspan='3'>Sensitivity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Energy sensitivity</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Paved roads</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n##Readiness\n\nReadiness seeks to measure the ability of a country’s private and public sectors to absorb additional investment resources and apply them effectively towards increasing resiliency to climate change. The axis has 3 categories of readiness: economic, social, and governance, and draws heavily on the commonly used measures found in the Index of Economic Freedom and World Governance Indicators. Readiness scores are calculated by summing component scores on the following weighted scale: 40% economic, 30% governance and 30% social. \n\n### Readiness indicators by sector and component\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>Business freedom (5.71%)</td><td class='economic' rowspan='7'>Economic readiness (40%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Financial freedom (5.71%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal freedom (5.71%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Government spending (5.71%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Investment freedom (5.71%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Monetary freedom (5.71%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Trade freedom (5.71%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Control of corruption (10%)</td><td class='governance' rowspan='3'>Governance (30%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Political stability & non-violence (10%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Voice & accountability (10%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tertiary education (10%)</td><td class='social' rowspan='4'>Social readiness (30%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Labor freedom (5%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile penetration (5%)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Rule of law (10%)</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n##Scoring indicators\n\nThe final indicator score calculation relies on a few steps and assumptions that require explanation. Each indicator contains four files named:\n\n* Raw0\n* Raw\n* Input\n* Score\n\n###Raw0 / raw files\n\nThe raw0 indicator file comes directly from the source of the data itself, without any modification or augmentation. The raw file is essentially the raw0 file, except that some values have been added in where the country's value is obvious. (For example, Austria has no coast line, so the raw files for coastal population and area have scores of \"0\" added in for Austria to reflect this.) \n\n###Input files\n\nSome indicators are missing some time-series values for some countries in their raw files. The input file fills all blank cells by either interpolating or extrapolating from the values present in the raw files. Interpolation between points uses a positive linear function for the intermediate values. Extrapolation beyond the most current data imposes a penalty score of subtracting 2% of the score for each subsequent year that needs to be filled in. This is done to encourage countries to report their most recent data.\n\n###Score files\n\nThe scores of each indicator are normalized within a 0 - 1 range. Since the units of each indicator vary, indicator-specific functions convert every input value to a score between 0 and 1. Some indicators employ threshold limits on the input values, making every instance of input values beyond or below these thresholds automatically receive a score of \"1\" or \"0\". This is enforced as a kind of 'saturation' measure, serving as points beyond which a country's GaIn™ score should be neither boosted nor penalized for further gains or losses within a given indicator. It also accommodates for extreme outliers that would otherwise dramatically skew the conversion function.\n\n##Missing data\n\nSome countries are missing data for every year for a given indicator. So, if a country does not have any values in their raw files, they receive no input and, hence, no score value for that indicator. If enough indicators are missing scores for a country, then the corresponding the country receives no sector or component score. In the same vein, if enough sector or component scores are absent for a country, it will not receive the corresponding readiness or vulnerability score. Any country missing either a vulnerability or readiness score does not receive a GaIn™ score.\n\n##GDP Corrected Scores and Delta Values\n\nThere is a strong positive correlation between a country's GDP and their GaIn and readiness scores (and negative with vulnerability). To account for this relationship, each of the GaIn, vulnerability and readiness scores have corresponding \"GDP Corrected\" scores as well. Each corrected score is calculated slightly differently, which is explained below:\n\n###Readiness GDP Corrections\n\nReadiness GDP corrected scores employ the following two formulas: \n\n* E(R) = -0.1913 + 0.0835 * Ln(GDP[PPP])\n* dR = E(R) - R\n\nReadiness GDP corrected scores first recalculate a readiness score based on a country's GDP using E(R). Then, the actual readiness score of the country is subtracted from this score. Thus, the displayed \"delta\" corrected scores represent the difference between what the country score the country is expected to have and what they actually have. Higher delta scores reflect higher corrected readiness scores.\n\n###Vulnerability GDP Corrections\n\nVulnerability GDP corrected scores employ the following two formulas: \n\n* E(V) = 0.9914 + (-0.076) * Ln(GDP[PPP])\n* dV = (V - E(V)) * (-1)\n\nFirst, the vulnerability of a country is recalculated based on a country's GDP using E(V). Then, the expected vulnerability score is subtracted from the country's actual vulnerability score. These corrected delta scores have been intentionally inverted so that higher delta scores represent higher corrected vulnerability scores.\n\n###GaIn GDP Corrections\n\nGDP corrected scores are the differences between countries' readiness deltas and vulnerability deltas using the following formula:\n\n* dG = dR - dV"
