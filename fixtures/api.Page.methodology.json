    "body": "The final GaIn score of a country reflects aggregated scores at several different levels. Below is a top-down explanation of every score used to calculate the GaIn score, the two primary indexes (vulnerability and readiness) down to the raw data themselves. The page ends with an explanation of the assumptions and methods used to convert the raw data into the scores that comprise sector and component values.\n\n##GaIn™\n\nThe GaIn score serves as an overall measure of a country&#39;s vulnerability to climate-related hazards and its readiness to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change and other global threads. It is calculated as the readiness score of a country minus its vulnerability score, which is then scaled to a score between 0 and 100 for ease of communication.\n\nThe GaIn Outlook is generated by looking at the development of the GaIn™ over the last two years.\n\n##Vulnerability\n\nVulnerability seeks to capture exposure to climate related hazards, sensitivity to their impacts and the ability to cope with those impacts. Vulnerability is analyzed in two different ways: (1) by three core components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, capacity), and (2) by four key sector indicators (water, food, health and infrastructure). For three sectors (water, food and health), qualitative and quantitative types of measures are incorporated. Quantitative measures include things like amount, how much is used, how many people have access, while qualitative measures include things like exposure to poor quality, impacts on people and access to quality management measures. Infrastructure comprises three key areas: energy, coasts and transportation, and is composed of only quantitative indicators. Vulnerability scores are calculated by taking the mean of the four sector scores and each sector and component score is calculated by taking the mean of their respective indicator scores. \n\n###Vulnerability indicators by sector and component\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n  <td> <p> </p> </td>\n  <td> <p> </p> </td>\n  <td> <p><b>Exposure</b></p> </td>\n  <td> <p><b>Sensitivity</b></p> </td>\n  <td> <p><b>Capacity</b></p> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b>Water</b></p> </td>\n  <td> <p><b>Quantitative</b></p> </td>\n  <td> <p>Projected change in precipitation </p> </td>\n  <td> <p>% internal and external freshwater water extracted for all uses</p> </td>\n  <td> <p>% Population with access to improved water supply</p> </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b></b></p> </td>\n  <td> <p><b>Qualitative</b></p> </td>\n  <td> <p>Projected change in temperature</p> </td>\n  <td> <p>Mortality among under 5 yr.-olds due to water-borne diseases</p></td>\n  <td> <p>% Population with access to improved sanitation</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>  <p><b>Food</b></p> </td>\n  <td>  <p><b>Quantitative</b></p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Projected change in agricultural (cereal) yield</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>% of population living in rural areas</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Agricultural capacity</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b></b></p> </td>\n  <td>  <p><b>Qualitative</b></p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Coefficient of variation in cereal crop yields</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Food import dependency</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Children under 5 suffering from malnutrition(%)</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>  <p><b>Health</b></p></td>\n  <td>  <p><b>Quantitative</b></p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Estimated impact of future climate change on deaths from\n  disease</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Health workers per capita</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Longevity</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b></b></p> </td> \n  <td> <p><b>Qualitative</b></p></td>\n  <td> <p>Mortality due to communicable (infectious) diseases (%)</p></td>\n  <td> <p>Health expenditure derived from external resources (%)</p></td>\n  <td> <p>Maternal mortality</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>  <p><b>Infras.</b></p></td>\n  <td>  <p><b>Coast</b></p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Land less than 5 m above sea-level (%)</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Population living less than 5 m above sea-level (%)</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Measured on the Readiness Axis</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b></b></p> </td>\n  <td>  <p><b>Energy </b></p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Population with access to reliable electricity (%)</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Energy at risk</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b></b></p> </td>\n  <td>  <p><b>Transport</b></p></td>\n  <td>  <p>Frequency of floods per unit area</p></td>\n  <td>  <p>% of roads paved</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\nAll measures are weighted equally.\n\n##Readiness\n\nReadiness seeks to measure the ability of a country’s private and public sectors to absorb additional investment resources and apply them effectively towards increasing resiliency to climate change. The axis has 3 categories of readiness: economic, social, and governance, and draws heavily on the commonly used measures found in the Index of Economic Freedom and World Governance Indicators. Readiness scores are calculated by summing component scores on the following weighted scale: 40% economic, 30% governance and 30% social.\n\n### Readiness indicators by sector and component\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b>Component</b></p></td>\n  <td> <p><b>Weight</b></p></td>\n  <td> <p><b>Measure (Weight)</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b>Economic</b></p></td>\n  <td> <p>40 %</p></td>\n  <td> <p>IEF Business freedom †</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>IEF Trade freedom †</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>IEF Fiscal Freedom †</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>IEF Government Spending †</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>IEF Monetary Freedom †</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>IEF Investment Freedom †</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>IEF Financial Freedom †</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b>Governance</b></p></td>\n  <td> <p>30 %</p></td>\n  <td> <p>WGI Voice &amp; Accountability ‡</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>WGI Political Stability &amp; Non-Violence ‡</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>WGI Control of Corruption ‡</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p><b>Social</b></p></td>\n  <td> <p>30 %</p></td>\n  <td> <p>Mobiles per 100 persons (5%)</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>IEF Labor Freedom (5%)</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p>Tertiary Education (10%)</p></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n  <td> <p></p></td>\n <td> <p>WGI Rule of Law (10%)</p></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n- IEF stands for Index of Economic Freedom.\n- WGI stands for World Governance Indicators.\n- † Equally Weighted (40% / 7 measures = 5.71% each)\n- ‡ Equally Weighted (30% / 3 measures = 10% each)\n\n## Selecting indicators\n\nThe main criteria for selecting Indicators among available candidates was:\n\n* Consistent with current knowledge and best practice;\n* Transparent and conceptually clear;\n* Accessible data, quality checked;\n* Potentially scalable to regional and/or sub-national;\n* Avoid incorporating broad socio-economic measures, such as GDP/capita, to minimize internal correlations;\n* Inclusive of as many countries as possible (Our country data base is UN countries as of May 2010);\n* Point to actionable and measurable improvements;\n* Have as much temporal data as possible from 1995 to 2010.\n\n## Scoring indicators\n\nThe final indicator score calculation relies on a few steps and assumptions that require explanation. Scores for each indicator involve four steps:\n\n- \"Raw0\": Sourced data\n- \"Raw\": Raw0 data + safe assumptions\n- \"Input\": Data Interpolations and extrapolations.\n- \"Score\": Scoring with thresholds.\n\nYou can find corresponding files for each step in the [Data download](/download).\n\n### Sourced data\n\nThese \"raw0\" values come directly from the source of the data itself, without any modification or augmentation. \n\n### Raw0 data + safe assumptions\n\n\"raw\" values are essentially equal to raw0, plus those added in where the country's value is obvious. (For example, Austria has no coast line, so the raw files for coastal population and area have scores of \"0\" added in for Austria to reflect this.) \n\n### Data Interpolations and extrapolations.\n\nMeasures are not reported for every year. The input file fills all blank cells by either interpolating or extrapolating from the values present in the raw files. Interpolation between points uses a linear function for the intermediate values. Extrapolation beyond the most current data, and before first reported data, are projected without variation. A yearly penalty score per extrapolated year could be implemented to emphasize the lack of reported data. Currently such penalty score is set to 0% per year.\n\n### Score files\n\nThe scores of each indicator are normalized within a 0 - 1 range. Since the units and range of each indicator vary, indicator-specific functions convert every input value to a score between 0 and 1. Some indicators employ threshold limits on the input values, making every instance of input values beyond or below these thresholds automatically receive a score of \"1\" or \"0\". This 'saturation' serves as points beyond which a country's score for each measure should be neither boosted nor penalized for further gains or losses within a given indicator. It also accommodates for extreme outliers that would otherwise dramatically skew the conversion function.\n\n## Missing data\n\nSome countries are missing data for every year for a given indicator. So, if a country does not have any values in their raw files, they receive no input and, hence, no score value for that indicator. If enough indicators are missing scores for a country, then the corresponding the country receives no sector or component score. In the same vein, if enough sector or component scores are absent for a country, it will not receive the corresponding readiness or vulnerability score. Any country missing either a vulnerability or readiness score does not receive a GaIn™ score.\n\n## GDP Corrected Scores\n\nThere is a strong direct correlation between a country's GDP† and their GaIn and readiness scores (and inverse with vulnerability). To account for this relationship, each of the GaIn, vulnerability and readiness scores have corresponding \"GDP Corrected\" scores as well.\n\n†: In what follows, GDP refers to Gross Domestic Product, per capita, measured with Power Purchase Parity with International 2005 Dollars.\n\n### Readiness GDP Corrections\n\nWe find a strong correlation between the Readiness Score and GDP. A Linear fit yields a R^2 of 0.XX, with the following parameters:\n\n    Expected Readiness = -0.1913 + 0.0835 * Ln(GDP)\n\nThe \"GDP corrected Readiness\" corresponds to the distante of the countries measured Readiness to the expected value for its GDP. Positive values reflect better (higher) Readiness than expected.\n\n### Vulnerability GDP Corrections\n\nWe find a high correlation between the Vulnerability Score and GDP. A Linear fit yields a R^2 of 0.XX, with the following parameters:\n\n    Expected Vulnerability = -0.1913 + 0.0835 * Ln(GDP)\n\nThe \"GDP corrected Vulnerability\" corresponds to the distante of the countries measured Vulnerability to the expected value for its GDP. Negative values reflect better (lower) Vulnerability than expected.\n\n### GaIn GDP Corrections\n\nWe find a significant correlation between the GaIn Score and GDP. A Linear fit yields a R^2 of 0.XX, with the following parameters:\n\n    Expected GaIn = -0.1913 + 0.0835 * Ln(GDP)\n\nThe \"GDP corrected GaIn\" corresponds to the distante of the country's measured GaIn to the expected value for its GDP. Positive values reflect better (lower) Vulnerability than expected."
