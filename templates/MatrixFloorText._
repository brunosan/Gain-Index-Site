<p>The Readiness Matrix illustrates the comparative resilience of countries. The vertical axis measures the relative vulnerability of countries. The horizontal axis measures to what degree a country is ready to deal with climatic and environmental changes.</p>

    <div class='quad tl'>
      <div class='matrix-overlay quad-tl'>
      Countries with a high Vulnerability score but a low level of Readiness have both a great need for investments and innovations to improve Readiness and a great urgency for action.

    <div class='quad tr'>
      <div class='matrix-overlay quad-tr'>
      Countries with a high Vulnerability score and a high Readiness score are on the road to responding effectively, but the remaining needs are greater. The private sector is more likely to participate here in an effort to improve the ability to adapt.

    <div class='quad bl'>
      <div class='matrix-overlay quad-bl'>
      Countries with low Vulnerability and low Readiness scores have few immediate challenges and more time to improve. There are likely enticing opportunities for public and private sectors to intervene.
